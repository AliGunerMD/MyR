The goal of RforMD is to provide some functions for personal use. Surely, any academic in medicine, can use any.   
I am open to improve.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RforMD from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AliGunerMD/RforMD")
library("RforMD")

```
