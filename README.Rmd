`{RforMD}` aims to provide some functions for personal use.  
Surely, any academic in medicine, can use any.   
I am open to improve. Do not hesitate for requests/issue reports.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RforMD from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AliGunerMD/RforMD")
library("RforMD")
```


## Example use

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("AliGunerMD/RforMD", force = TRUE)
library(RforMD)

library(palmerpenguins)
library(finalfit)

```
The idea of this package comes from the personal needs.   
The [finalfit](https://finalfit.org) package is one of the most useful package for a researcher who works in medicine.  
It provides great functionalities. I just want to improve some parts of them, so, try to extent it to save some time.  

Later, I also added some functions for [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/) with the same idea. to make faster and totally reproducible Word tables.   
If you are happy with html output, try [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/), [gtExtras](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/) packages.

All analysis starts with the exploration of data.  
Among many options like `summary()`, `str()`, `dplyr::glimpse()`, `skimr::skim()`;  
I prefer `finalfit::ff_glimpse()` with some modifications.


#### Continuous variables

```{r}
#| label: Continuous
ag_ff_glimpse(penguins, type = "cont")
```

#### Categorical variables
```{r}
#| label: Categorical
ag_ff_glimpse(penguins, type = "cat") 

```

#### Categorical variables with strata
```{r}
#| label: Categorical_strata
ag_ff_glimpse(penguins, type = "cat", strata = "sex", flex_font_size = 9) 

```
